# Reinforcment-Learning
This project utiliezes StableBasline3, GymAi in order to implement a Reinforcment Learning model. 
This model is able to learn how to make a collision-less class schedule, thanks to its reward function and use of Proximal Policy Optimization.
Thanks to this project I was able to learn a lot about programing and working with simple RL models.
